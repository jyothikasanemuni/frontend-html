        <big>O</big>ne day, a mighty lion was sleeping in the jungle when a little mouse accidentally <i>ran across his paw</i>. The lion woke up and caught the mouse, ready to eat it. The mouse pleaded,<u> “Please, let me go, and someday I'll repay your kindness.”</u> The lion laughed but decided to let the mouse go. A few days later, the lion got caught in a <i>hunter's net </i>. The mouse heard his roar, ran to him, and chewed through the ropes to free him. The lion was grateful and realized <mark>even small creatures can make a big difference.</mark></p>
